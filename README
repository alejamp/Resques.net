In order to run the tests you must have a Redis Server running.

If you already have one, please setup the URLs on app.config.

If not, you may want to use a x64 binary in services/redis.io.2.2.2.x64. 
	Execute start.bat

What comes next?
I'm thinking that a "new item" event/notification will be usefull. 
Using subscriptions for Pub/Sub Redis.io feature, I think it may work.
Meanwhile this queue needs continues pulling in order to get new items.
