# ServiceStack Redis Client Extensions
[Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/) is one of the fastest and feature-rich key-value stores to come from the [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) movement.
It is similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile, and values can either be strings lists, sets, sorted sets or hashes.
[ServiceStack's C# Redis Client](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis) is an Open Source C# Redis client based on [Miguel de Icaza](http://twitter.com/migueldeicaza) previous efforts with [redis-sharp](http://github.com/migueldeicaza/redis-sharp).
RedisExtensions adds support for Queue, Capped Collections and Stacks when you use ServiceStacks's C# Redis Client.

# How to use it?

In order to run the tests you must have a Redis Server running.
If you already have one, please setup the URLs in app.config.
If not, you may want to use a x64 binary in services/redis.io.2.2.2.x64. 
	Execute start.bat

# More infomation about Redis?
I strongly suggets you to visit [ServiceStack's C# Redis Client](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis) and take a look to the README file.
	
# What comes next?
I'm thinking that a "new item" event/notification will be usefull. 
Using subscriptions for Pub/Sub Redis.io feature, I think it may work.
Meanwhile this queue needs continues pulling in order to get new items.
